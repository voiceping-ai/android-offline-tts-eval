# Android Offline TTS Eval

## Critical: No Emulators or Simulators

**DO NOT create, boot, or run Android Emulators or iOS Simulators.** All testing must be done on physical devices only.

- Do not run `emulator`, `avdmanager create avd`, or any Android emulator commands
- Do not run `xcrun simctl create`, `xcrun simctl boot`, or any simulator commands
- Do not suggest using emulators/simulators as a testing strategy

Disk space is severely limited. Emulator images consume 10-20+ GB. All target devices are available as physical hardware.
