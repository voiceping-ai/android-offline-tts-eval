    { "id": "long_01", "text": "This is a longer prompt for measuring throughput. The goal is to produce enough audio to observe performance differences across models. We will run the same text many times, collect synthesis time in milliseconds, and compute tokens per second and the real time factor. If the model produces audio quickly, the real time factor will be low. If it is slow, the factor will rise above one." },
    { "id": "long_02", "text": "Here is another long prompt. Offline text to speech models vary in quality, size, and compute cost. Some use ONNX Runtime on CPU, while others use platform APIs. In this benchmark, we do not judge pronunciation with a human score. Instead, we measure how fast the model can generate a waveform for the same input. This makes the results easy to compare across devices and models." }
